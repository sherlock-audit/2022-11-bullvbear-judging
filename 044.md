# batch functions set msg.sender to BvbProtocol's address instead of the callers.

## Summary
When a caller uses a batch function, msg.sender is set to BvbProtocol's address instead of the callers.

## Vulnerability Detail
When, for instance, batchMatchOrder is called msg.sender is set to either the bull or bear. Since the msg.sender is the BvbProtocol's address instead of the callers, the contract is on the hook.

## Impact
An operator could use this to potentially remove collateral from the contract by setting the contract to the bear. When the contract fails to send the NFT, the operator can reclaim the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use delegatecall to call the contract itself such that msg.sender is maintained. 
address(this).delegatecall(...);
