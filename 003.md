# Fee comes from global variable rather than order details

## Summary

The fees are calculated based on the global `fee` variable, rather than the `fee` included with the order.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each order contains a `fee` variable, which should set the fee for this order.
```solidity
struct Order {
    uint premium;
    uint collateral;
    uint validity;
    uint expiry;
    uint nonce;
    uint16 fee;
    address maker;
    address asset;
    address collection;
    bool isBull;
}
```
When an order is matched, the protocol confirms that the fee in the order is greater than or equal to the global fee.

```solidity
require(order.fee >= fee, "INVALID_FEE");
```
However, when it comes time to calculate the fee, the global fee is used. 
```solidity
// Fees
uint bullFees;
uint bearFees;
if (fee > 0) {
    bullFees = (order.collateral * fee) / 1000;
    bearFees = (order.premium * fee) / 1000;

    withdrawableFees[order.asset] += bullFees + bearFees;
}
```

## Impact

The expected fee included in an order will not be charged.

## Recommendation

Replace `fee` with `order.fee` when used for calculations:

```solidity
if (order.fee > 0) {
    bullFees = (order.collateral * order.fee) / 1000;
    bearFees = (order.premium * order.fee) / 1000;

    withdrawableFees[order.asset] += bullFees + bearFees;
}
```

Alternatively, if this is the intended behavior, rename `order.fee` to `order.maxFee` for clarity that they are setting a max parameter, and not actually the fee they expect to be charged.
