# `buyPosition()` May Transfer An Unnecessary Large Amount of Tokens

## Summary

The function `buyPosition()` does not cap the maximum amount of `msg.value`. Therefore a user has no restriction for the amount to tokens they may transfer for a position.

## Vulnerability Detail

The require statement in `buyPosition()` does not limit the maximum value of `msg.value`. A user who accidentally send too much ETH to this function will lose the excess ETH.

`msg.value` can be any value higher than `sellOrder.price`. If there is an extra decimal place in `msg.value` then this amount will be transferred to the `sellOrder.maker` and is lost to the user.

## Impact

The taker will lose `msg.value - sellOrder.price`. Since the taker will never have motivation to send more than `sellOrder.price` there is no benefit to them sending more than `sellOrder.price`. However, there is the risk that they may send an arbitrarily large amount and lose their tokens.

Note this is commented in the code on line [#492](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L491) as follows. However, this practice is avoidable and can prevent loss of funds.
```solidity
// Buyer could send more ETH than asked
```

## Code Snippet

[buyPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L490-L496)
```solidity
            // Buyer could send more ETH than asked
            require(msg.value >= sellOrder.price, "INVALID_ETH_VALUE");
            require(sellOrder.asset == weth, "INCOMPATIBLE_ASSET_ETH_VALUE");

            WETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
            IERC20(weth).safeTransfer(sellOrder.maker, msg.value);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider changing the require statement on line #492 to be a strict equality to prevent accidental loss of funds.

```solidity
require(msg.value == sellOrder.price, "INVALID_ETH_VALUE");
```
