# Order/SellOrder hash can be reproduced, and pass checkIsValidOrder/checkIsValidSellOrder

## Summary
The hash of `Order` and `SellOrder` can be reproduced by the same user, so as to pass the check in function `checkIsValidOrder` and `checkIsValidSellOrder`, i.e. a user can make an order twice or more. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Let us use `struct Order` as example, defined in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L33-L44

All the parameters of `Order` is user-defined, including the `nonce` parameter that only requires greater or equal to `minimumValidNonce` without any self-increasing mechanism. And thus, Order/SellOrder hash can reproduce by the same user, and pass the check in `checkIsValidOrder` and `checkIsValidSellOrder`.

Then, we can imagine such scenario could happen:
1.  Bob makes an `Order` of the bear side to sell his NFT;
2.  Alice sees this `Order` offer, and call `matchOrder` to take it by being the bull side;
3.  Actually, Bob does not want to sell his NFT at current price at all, and he just intends to display it in the window. He makes another new `Order` with the same parameter setting, including the same `Order.premium` and `Order.collateral`;
4.  Then, Bob uses another address belong to himself to take this new `Order` by calling `matchOrder`.  According to the logic of `matchOrder`, the `contractId` is the same (`uint contractId = uint(orderHash);`), and `bulls[contractId]` is replaced from Alice's address to Bob's address;
5.  Finally, Alice's matched order is cancelled by Bob's manipulation. This manipulation undermines the stability of the protocol.

## Impact
The normal operation of an matched order is cancelled by manipulation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To add a self-increasing mechanism for `Order.nonce` and `SellOrder.nonce`. And it is better to add a chain ID to `struct Order` and  `SellOrder` if bullvbear plans to deploy on multi-chains in the future.
