# The matched Order can be manipulated

## Summary
The matched `Order` can be manipulated by proposing another order on the same collection. I.e., a `Order` maker of the bear side can always raise the price of the collection he sells to avoid a deal with other persons' addresses.

## Vulnerability Detail
`struct Order` is defined in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L33-L44

All the parameters of `Order` is user-defined, including the `nonce` parameter that only requires greater or equal to `minimumValidNonce` without any self-increasing mechanism. And thus, a maker can propose another `Order` with small changes to aovid hash check.

Then, we can imagine such scenario could happen:
1.  Bob makes an `Order` of the bear side to sell his NFT;
2.  Alice sees this `Order` offer, and call `matchOrder` to take it by being the bull side;
3.  Actually, Bob does not want to sell his NFT at current price at all, and he just intends to display it in the window. He makes another new `Order` with the slightly different parameter setting, including `Order.premium` and `Order.collateral`;
4.  Then, Bob uses another address belong to himself to take this new `Order` by calling `matchOrder`;
5.  Finally, Alice's matched order cannot be settled by Bob's manipulation. This manipulation undermines the stability of the protocol.

## Impact
A normal matched order would never be settled by manipulation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To let the order of a single NFT can be matched only once, and compete a matched order by using function `buyPosition`.
