# The code don't use nonce to identify orders, instead it uses order hash which is not best practice and could cause some issues like: duplicate nonce for different orders, can't quickly identify cancelled orders without order's all info, can't cancel multiple orders, can't cancel order without knowing order's all parameters

## Summary
The code don't use nonce to identify orders, instead it uses order hash which is not best practice and could cause some issues like: duplicate nonce for different orders, can't quickly identify cancelled orders without order's all info, can't cancel multiple orders, can't cancel order without knowing order's all parameters
## Vulnerability Detail
It's common practice in EIP-712 encoding to use nonce to identify singer messages and prevent replay attacks and create ability to make signed messages invalid. but in bvb uses order hash for identifying orders and cancelling them. this can cause some problems like:

1. duplicate nonce for different orders
2. can't quickly identify cancelled orders without order's all info
3. can't cancel multiple orders
4. can't cancel order without knowing order's all parameters
   This problems and similar problems are created because order hash is not iterable and also to calculate order hash it requires all 
   order info.
   But nonce can be iterable and only the nonce of orders are required to identify orders.
## Impact
1. duplicate nonce for different orders
2. can't quickly identify cancelled orders without order's all info
3. can't cancel multiple orders
4. can't cancel order without knowing order's all parameters
   This problems and similar problems are created because order hash is not iterable and also to calculate order hash it requires all 
   order info.
   But nonce can be iterable and only the nonce of orders are required to identify orders.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use nonce for identifying orders and use order hash and signature for validating orders.
