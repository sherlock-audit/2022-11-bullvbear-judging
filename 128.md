# Allow changing of recipient for withdrawToken

## Summary
Multi-sig contracts are gaining popularity, and so are smart-contract wallets. However not all smart contract wallets have the necessary callback functions implemented to receive ERC721 tokens. If a user creates a bull position with such a smart-contract wallet, their NFT will be forever stuck in the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
NFTs can be forever stuck in the protocol if positions are created by a smart contract wallet which cannot receive NFTs / doesnt have the necessary callback function
## Impact
NFTs can be forever stuck in the wallet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Can be mitigated in two ways:
1. Have an admin function with the ability to recover NFTs from withdrawableCollectionTokenId. Users can contact admin to recover NFT to a different EOA/contract wallet
2. Have a function that lets the recipient nominate a new recipient
