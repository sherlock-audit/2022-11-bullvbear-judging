# Fake orders can be batch matched to drain the protocol

## Summary

If a user calls `batchMatchOrders()` with multiple orders with the same takerPrice, their `msg.value` will be applied to all of them. This can be used by a malicious actor to set up fake orders, match them, and then reclaim them in order to drain the whole protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

When orders are batch matched, the protocol iterates through the orders and calls `matchOrder()` on each of them. This call passes on the `msg.value` of the main call, which allows a user to match multiple orders by only paying for one.

However, because the result of this is stealing of funds from the protocol and not another user, it can be abused in more damaging ways to empty the protocol's funds. 

Here is an example of how we might drain the protocol of 10,000 ETH:
- A user creates an arbitrary number of Orders, let's say 101
- These orders have a short expiry time and a very high collateral price, let's say 100 ETH
- The maker takes the bear side, and set the premium to 0, so there is no need to deposit anything
- They then call `batchMatchOrder()` with all the orders, and a `msg.value` equal to 100 ETH
- The result is that they are the bull on 100 orders with 100 ETH collateral and 0 ETH premium
- After waiting until the expiry time passes, they call `batchReclaimContracts()` on all of them
- Each contract calculates the amount they are owed as `order.premium + order.collateral` and sends them 100 ETH
- The result is that they sent 100 ETH into the contract, and pulled out 10,100 shortly thereafter

## Impact

A malicious user can drain the WETH of the entire protocol at any time.

## Recommendation

Remove the ability to match batch orders, or the ability to pay using msg.value.
