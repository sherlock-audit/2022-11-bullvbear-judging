# Possible DOS in `batchMatchOrders`, `batchSettleContracts` and `batchReclaimContracts`

## Summary

All the batch based `batchMatchOrders`, `batchSettleContracts` and `batchReclaimContracts` will revert when the size of order array is big.

## Vulnerability Detail

All the batch based [orders ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L546-L579) process the matching, settling and reclaim. These are separate function which involve considerable amount of processing that could consume more gas,

As there are no cap on how many number of orders can be there, this could lead to DOS when order size is large

## Impact

As there are no cap on how many number of orders can be there, this could lead to DOS when order size is large
