# withdrawToken() Malicious users can let other user's NFT be locked

## Summary
#withdrawToken() Not followed "Checks Effects Interactions " , Malicious users can reenter to #settleContract() overwrite other user's "withdrawableCollectionTokenId[NFT]=0"

https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html

## Vulnerability Detail
Assuming that there is alreadyï¼šwithdrawableCollectionTokenId[nft]=alice
At this time the malicious user alice can create this NFT order, and user "bob" matchOrder

then
Alice can call withdrawToken()
step:
1.#withdrawToken() ->  IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(alice)->  alice#onERC721Received()
2.alice#onERC721Received() re-enter  BvbProtocol#settleContract() 
3. in #settleContract() ,  if bob can't receive  NFT, will put NFT to BvbProtocol then write withdrawableCollectionTokenId[nft] = bob
4.back to #withdrawToken() will set withdrawableCollectionTokenId[nft] = 0

so user bob can't withdrawToken() her NFT,because overwrite withdrawableCollectionTokenId[nft] = 0

```solidity
    function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {//***@audit without nonReentrant****//
....

        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId); //***@audit call transfer first , re-enter settleContract() to set withdrawableCollectionTokenId[nft] == bob***//

        withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId] = address(0); //***@audit  overwrite withdrawableCollectionTokenId[nft]=0 , bob lost nft//

        emit WithdrawnToken(orderHash, tokenId, recipient);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
followed "Checks Effects Interactions "

```solidity
-   function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {
-   function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public nonReentrant { 
        address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;

        address recipient = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId];

-        // Transfer NFT to recipient
-        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);

        // This token is not withdrawable anymore
        withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId] = address(0);

+        // Transfer NFT to recipient
+        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);

        emit WithdrawnToken(orderHash, tokenId, recipient);
    }
```
