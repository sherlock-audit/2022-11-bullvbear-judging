# No check for `sellOrder.asset == order.asset`

## Summary

Users will loose assets if sellOrder asset is not equal order asset

## Vulnerability Detail

In `checkIsValidSellOrder` sellOrder asset is checked if it exists in allowedAssets, but it is not validated to be the same as order asset. 
If a user had signed with a different assets and the buyer had set allowance to the contract in token `sellOrder.asset`, the maker will be transferred different token

## Impact

Maker will receive wrong tokens
