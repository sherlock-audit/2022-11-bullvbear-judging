# The transferPosition() function does not check if the recipient is a contract

## Summary

The bull can transfer his position for free with the ```transferPosition()``` function, the problem is that the function does not check the recipient.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```transferPosition()``` function does not check the recipient if it is a contract or not.

## Impact

If the ```transferPosition()``` function transfers to a contract which does not have ```onERC721Received``` function, the recipient contract will not able to ```withdrawToken()``` the NFT. More serious if the contract does not have an upgrade pattern.

Test:

```solidity
// SettleContract.t.sol
// I created a contract (naivecontract) with no functions.
function test_oxbepresent_transfer_to_naivecontract_cannot_withdraw_NFT() public {
    BvbProtocol.Order memory order = defaultOrder();
    bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);

    bytes memory signature = signOrder(bullPrivateKey, order);
    bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);

    // Transfer position to naive contract
    vm.prank(bull);
    bvb.transferPosition(orderHash, true, address(naiveusercontract));
    vm.stopPrank();

    // the NFT will be in the BVB Protocol
    bvb.settleContract(order, tokenIdBear);
    assertEq(doodles.ownerOf(tokenIdBear), address(bvb), "NFT should have been transfered to BVB Protocol");

    // Wtihdraw the NFT but the naive contract will does not have the onERC721Received function
    // so the NFT will be stuck in BVB Protocol
    vm.expectRevert();
    bvb.withdrawToken(orderHash, tokenIdBear);
}
```

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L521

```solidity
function transferPosition(bytes32 orderHash, bool isBull, address recipient) public {
    // ContractId
    uint contractId = uint(orderHash);

    if (isBull) {
        // Check that the msg.sender is the Bull
        require(msg.sender == bulls[contractId], "SENDER_NOT_BULL");

        bulls[contractId] = recipient;
    } else {
        // Check that the msg.sender is the Bear
        require(msg.sender == bears[contractId], "SENDER_NOT_BEAR");

        bears[contractId] = recipient;
    }

    emit TransferedPosition(orderHash, isBull, recipient);
}
```

## Tool used

VisualStudio/Foundry

## Recommendation

The [documentation](https://bullvbear.gitbook.io/home/understanding-the-protocol/smart-contracts#transfer-an-existing-bear-or-bull-position) says the transfer is to another wallet. So the ```transferPosition()``` function can check that transfer to contracts are not allowed.
