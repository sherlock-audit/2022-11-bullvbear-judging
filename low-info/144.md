# Fee on transfer tokens is not supported

## Summary

Fee on transfer token will cause revert if balance is lesser than the input value

## Vulnerability Detail

If order.asset is a fee-on-transfer token, the amount transferred into the contract will be lesser than the input value, This will cause users to loose tokens and will revert if the balance is lesser than the value stored in the order

## Impact

Function `reclaimContract` will revert if balance is lesser than the bullAssetAmount

```solidity
        if (bullAssetAmount > 0) {
            // Transfer payment tokens to the Bull
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bull, bullAssetAmount);
        }
