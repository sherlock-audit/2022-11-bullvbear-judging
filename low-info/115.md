### Fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported

There are ERC20 tokens that charge a fee for every transfer() or transferFrom().

In the current implementation, the contract assumes and requires that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount, which means fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported.

They should not be whitelisted.
