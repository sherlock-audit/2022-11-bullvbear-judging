# Immutable weth address may lead to some tough situations

## Summary
The address of WETH contract is immutable, and initialized in constructor. But it may possibly lead to tough situations

## Vulnerability Detail
An immutable WETH address cannot deal with following situations:
1. An update of WETH contract is deployed to another address possibly due to upgrade, or bug fixes. A typical example is DAI. The DAI contract has been redeployed on mainet 3 years ago, and the contract before redeployment is now call SAI.
2. Happen to pass incorrect initialized parameters to constructor, needed to be redeployed.
Also the constructor lacks of zeor-address check.
3. Strategy update with another wrapped ETH contract.

## Impact
Immutable WETH contract cannot deal with the situatoins above.
