# There is a risk that the `fee` variable is accidentally initialized to 0 and platform loses money

## Summary
With the fee in the `BvbProtocol.sol` file, the initial rate are set with an argument of type uint256, but there is no check that prevents this rate from starting with 0.

There is a risk that the `fee` variable is accidentally initialized to 0

Starting fee  with 0 are an administrative decision, but since there is no information about this in the documentation and NatSpec comments during the audit, we can assume that it will not be 0

In addition, it is a strong belief that it will not be 0, as it is an issue that will affect the platform revenues.

## Vulnerability Detail
Although the value initialized with 0 by mistake or forgetting can be changed later by `onlyOwner`, in the first place it can be exploited by users and cause huge amount usage

There is a critical difference between updating the `fee` to 0 afterwards and forgetting it to be 0 at the beginning.


## Impact

The `fee` value is initially set in the `setFee()` function, critically only the `_fee <= 50` check is done, this is correct so that the user is not exploited, but the platform bypasses the other important check and does not check for an accidental initialization of 0 ;

## Code Snippet
```solidity


src/BvbProtocol.sol:
  292:     constructor(uint16 _fee, address _weth) {
  293:         weth = payable(_weth);
  294: 
  295:         setFee(_fee);
  296:     }


src/BvbProtocol.sol:
  841       */
  842:     function setFee(uint16 _fee) public onlyOwner {
  843:         // Fee rate can't be greater than 5%
  844:         require(_fee <= 50, "INVALID_FEE_RATE");
  845: 
  846:         fee = _fee;
  847: 
  848:         emit UpdatedFee(_fee);
  849:     }


```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an if block to the function ;

```solidity

src/BvbProtocol.sol:
  841       */
  842:     function setFee(uint16 _fee) public onlyOwner {
  843:         // Fee rate can't be greater than 5%
  844:         require(_fee <= 50, "INVALID_FEE_RATE");
+                 if(_fee = 0) revert ZeroFeeError();
  846:         fee = _fee;
  847: 
  848:         emit UpdatedFee(oldfee , newfee);
  849:     }
