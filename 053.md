# Order cannot be matched if `order.validity == block.timestamp`

## Summary
An order cannot be matched if `order.validity == block.timestamp` due to `checkIsValidOrder()` which does a strict comparison. We note that validity is defined as "**The timestamp after which this order is invalid**" in the contract in [BvbProtocol.sol#L24](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L24) which suggests that order should still be valid when `order.validity == block.timestamp`.

## Vulnerability Detail
A strict comparison is used in `checkIsValidOrder()`.
> `require(order.validity > block.timestamp, "EXPIRED_VALIDITY_TIME")`

An order is considered invalid when `order.validity == block.timestamp` but should not be the case according to what is defined in the contract.

## Impact
An order cannot be matched when `order.validity == block.timestamp`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change to `require(order.validity >= block.timestamp, "EXPIRED_VALIDITY_TIME")`
