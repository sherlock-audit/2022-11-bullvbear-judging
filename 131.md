# It should use timelock on `allowedAsset` and `allowedCollection`

## Summary

It's a centralized issue in the protocol. The owner can adjust `allowedAsset` and `allowedCollection` anytime and delete some assets/collections immediately to deny the match of some orders.

## Vulnerability Detail

The owner can call `setAllowedCollection` and `setAllowedAsset` to set `allowedAsset` and `allowedCollection`. However it doesn't have timelock, the owner can set them anytime to block users to call `matchOrder()` because `checkIsValidOrder()` will be reverted on [L754](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L754) and [L757](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L757).

## Impact

Users will be unable to match orders due to the malicious/compromised owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use timelock to prevent centralized issues. For example:
```solidity
    function setAllowedAsset(address asset, bool allowed) public onlyOwner {
        pendingAsset = asset;
        pendingAllowed = allowed;
        setAllowedAssetTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        emit PendingAllowAsset(asset, allowed);
    }

    function approveAllowedAsset() public onlyOwner {
        require(pendingAsset != address(0));
        if (block.timestamp >= (setAllowedAssetTimestamp + 3 days)) {
            allowedAsset[pendingAsset] = pendingAllowed;
            emit AllowAsset(pendingAsset, pendingAllowed);

            pendingAsset = address(0);
            pendingAllowed = false;
        }
    }
```
