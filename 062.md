# There can 2 orders that are the same  but the second order will revert

## Summary
When there are 2 orders of the same the second order will have the same orderHash because of no nonce and bull will have an address 
## Vulnerability Detail
let's say 1 order is hash 0x232  and 2 order has the same but when the  order is validated the second time it will fail with
this code:
```solidity 
      require(
            bulls[uint256(orderHash)] == address(0),
            "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED"
        );
```
and this can happen  when using signatures in mappings that are not recommended a example of this can happen is :
steps:
Alice(bull) option with (bob)(bear) and with doodle etc:same parms
2 order: same thing 
and since Alice is already the bull it will revert
## Impact
It will revert causing good orders not to  go through 
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
      require(
            bulls[uint256(orderHash)] == address(0),
            "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED"
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
First, try not to use signatures in mappings but the fix I would do is to have nonce per order that is in the order struct.
