# Reentrancy in `transferProsition()` Will Overwrite State Variables

## Summary

There are no reentrnacy guards for the function `transferPosition()` as a result it's possible to reenter this function during `buyPosition()`. The impact is any state changes the occur during `transferPosition()` will be overwritten.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `buyPosition()` transfers the bull or bear position of an order to the `msg.sender`. This function also makes external calls to `sellOrder.asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, sellOrder.maker, sellOrder.price)`. Certain ERC20 tokens have an `onTokenRecieve()` function which gives control of execution to the `to` address.

If the `sellOrder.maker` is a malicious smart control and controls execution they may then call `transferPosition()` since there is no `nonReentrant` guard on that function.

`transferPosition()` will update one of the mappings `bulls[contractId]` or `bears[contractId]` then finish executing allowing control to revert to `buyPosition()`. 

`buyPosition()` will then finish executing after line #498 and it too will update the mappings `bulls` or `bears`. It is possible to update `bulls[contractId]` or `bears[contractId]` for the same `contractId` in both `buyPosition()` and `transferPosition()`. The impact is any changes made in `transferPosition()` will be undone.

## Impact

The impact here is any changes made during the reentrancy into `transferPosition()` are undone. This may make the reentrnacy less value to attacking the `BvbProtocol` contract since the end result is the same as if `buyPosition()` was called without a reentrancy.

However, this is a significant threat to third party smart contracts who intend use the `transferPosition()` or `bulls[contractId]` / `bears[contractId]` functions since they will all have values which are going to be overwritten.

This is a case of read-only reentrancy (or just reentrancy if they also call `transferPosition()`)  which is only a threat to third party contracts hence the issue is rated medium rather than high.

## Code Snippet
[buyPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L498-L505)
```solidity
        } else if (sellOrder.price > 0) {
            IERC20(sellOrder.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, sellOrder.maker, sellOrder.price);
        }

        if (sellOrder.isBull) {
            bulls[contractId] = msg.sender;
        } else {
            bears[contractId] = msg.sender;
        }
```

[transferPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L521-L538)
```solidity
    function transferPosition(bytes32 orderHash, bool isBull, address recipient) public {
        // ContractId
        uint contractId = uint(orderHash);

        if (isBull) {
            // Check that the msg.sender is the Bull
            require(msg.sender == bulls[contractId], "SENDER_NOT_BULL");

            bulls[contractId] = recipient;
        } else {
            // Check that the msg.sender is the Bear
            require(msg.sender == bears[contractId], "SENDER_NOT_BEAR");

            bears[contractId] = recipient;
        }

        emit TransferedPosition(orderHash, isBull, recipient);
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This issue may be mitigated by adding a `nonReentrant` modifier to `transferPosition()`
