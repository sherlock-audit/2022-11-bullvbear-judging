# `withdrawToken()` should be able to specify the `recipient` in calldata

## Summary

`withdrawToken()` should provides a `recipient` parameter to avoid failed `IERC721.safeTransferFrom()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `withdrawToken()` is needed, `withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId]` most certainly won't be able to receive with `ERC721.safeTransferFrom()`.

## Impact

Bull may not be able to withdraw their NFT.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId, address recipient) public {
    address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;

-    address recipient = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId];
+    require(msg.sender == withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId], "unauthorized");

    // Transfer NFT to recipient
    IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);

    // This token is not withdrawable anymore
    withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId] = address(0);

    emit WithdrawnToken(orderHash, tokenId, recipient);
}
```
