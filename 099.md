# bull can unmatch an already matched order

## Summary

The function ``checkIsValidOrder`` checks that an order is already matched by only looking at the bull side of the mapping of a specific order. By using ``transferPositon`` we can unmatch an already matched order.

## Vulnerability Detail

The following lines inside ``checkIsValidOrder`` are only considering the bull position side as a valid match indicator
```solidity
        // Check that there is no bull set for this order -> not matched
        require(bulls[uint(orderHash)] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");
```

## Impact
A bull user can decide which bear user can match with his/hers order by **temporary** transferring a position ownership to the **zero address** by calling ``transferPosition`` function.

When the next bear user comes along and calls *again* ``matchOrder`` the **bull ownership is restored to the original bull** user because the following lines:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L336-L345

The **removed** bear in the midtime cannot settle the order because the call ``settleContract`` will revert because bull address is zero and will revert with ``WRONG_FROM`` reason.

## Code Snippet
The following test show an unmatch of an already matched contract

```solidity
function testBullUnmatchMatchedOrder() public {
    BvbProtocol.Order memory order = defaultOrder();

    bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);
    bytes memory signature = signOrder(bullPrivateKey, order);

    // first match happens here
    bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);


    // unmatch order
    vm.prank(bull);
    bvb.transferPosition(orderHash, true, address(0));

    // sometime later ..a new match can occur
    bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);
}
```

The following test shows that the unmatched bear user cannot settle the previously matched contract. It is reverted with WRONG_FROM reason.

```solidity
    function testCannotSettleTransferedOrder() public {
        BvbProtocol.Order memory order = defaultOrder();

        bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);
        bytes memory signature = signOrder(bullPrivateKey, order);
        bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);

        vm.prank(bull);
        bvb.transferPosition(orderHash, true,address(0));

        vm.expectRevert("WRONG_FROM");
        bvb.settleContract(order,1);
    }
```

## Tool used
foundry

## Recommendation
Change the verification of an already matched order to check if order is inside the ``matchedOrders`` mapping:

From:

```solidity
        // Check that there is no bull set for this order -> not matched
        require(bulls[uint(orderHash)] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");
```

To:
```solidity
        require(matchedOrders[order] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");
```
