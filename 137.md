# Missing settled orders check

## Summary
There are three states which mark the end of an order: settled, reclaimed and cancelled. When matching an order, the `checkIsValidOrder` function makes checks to ensure that:
1. reclaimed orders aren't matched. This is ensured by checking `order.expiry`
2. cancelled orders aren't matched. This is ensured by checking `!canceledOrders[]` require statement

It is never checked before matching if an offer has already been settled.
## Vulnerability Detail
Attacker does the following steps:
1. Create order as a bear.
2. Match against their own order as the bull.
3. Settle the order by calling `settleContract`. This transfer NFTs to themself, along with collateral. Net cost = fees. This also sets `settledContracts[contractId] = true;`
4. Transfer away ownership to address(0) from the bull's side. This sets `bulls[uint(orderHash)] = address(0)`
5. Have another bull match. A bull can match since the bull of this order is address(0), which bypasses all the checks in `checkIsValidOrder` function
6. This bull has paid the premium, but cannot ever call `reclaimContract` function since the `require(!settledContracts[contractId], "SETTLED_CONTRACT");` will never pass as the contract is already marked as settled.
7. The bear can also never settle the order, but their cost is very low (only the premium). This is essentially a stuck order
## Impact
Trap orders which can never be settled or reclaimed, losing the bull their premium

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a require statement to check for settled orders in `checkIsValidOrder` function
`require(!settledContracts[uint(orderHash)], "Order already settled");`
