# Wrong put option mechanism, bear should not receive premium in any case.

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L402-L406

## Vulnerability Detail
American put option allow the bear (option buyer) to execute at any point up to expiration timestamp. This ability gives the buyer the freedom to demand the bull (seller) takes delivery of the underlying asset whenever the price falls below the specified strike price.

To get that ability, buyer has to pay `premium` to seller. We can consider it as a price for the right to sell NFT in the period. So bear (option buyer) get that right and pay the `premium`. However in the codebase, when a contract is settled, the bear got the `premium` back, which is wrong. The bull has no incentive to sell that option and get nothing back.

## Impact
Wrong put option mechanism, option seller (bull) is in loss.

## Code Snippet

In the `settleContract(...)` function, `premium` is transferred back to bear.
```solidity
uint bearAssetAmount = order.premium + order.collateral;
if (bearAssetAmount > 0) {
    // Transfer payment tokens to the Bear
    IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bear, bearAssetAmount); // @audit bear should not receive premium
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider transferring `premium` to the bull instead of bear in `settleContract()` function
