# It should store contractId instead of recipient in `withdrawableCollectionTokenId`

## Summary

`settleContract()` would store the bull address in `withdrawableCollectionTokenId`, If the bull cannot receive the NFT. However, the bull may not be able to withdraw the NFT through `withdrawToken()`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If a bull cannot receive the NFT in `settleContract()`, it would store the bull address in `withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId]`. The protocol uses this mechanism to prevent the malicious bull from blocking `settleContract()`.

However, if a bull mistakenly uses an address that cannot receive the NFT, he/she cannot withdraw the NFT through `withdrawToken()` since the protocol store the broken address in `withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId]`.


## Impact

If a bull mistakenly uses an address that cannot receive the NFT, he/she cannot withdraw the NFT after the bear settles the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix the problem, it should store contractId instead of the bull address in `withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId]`. Then, the bull can use `transferPosition()` to replace the broken address.

And modify `withdrawToken()`
```solidity
    function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {
        address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;

        uint contractId = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId];
        require(contractId != 0);
        
        address recipient = bulls[contractId] ;

        // Transfer NFT to recipient
        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);

        // This token is not withdrawable anymore
        withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId] = 0;

        emit WithdrawnToken(orderHash, tokenId, recipient);
    }
```
