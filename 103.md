# position ownership transfer breaks order cancellation functionality

## Summary
If user Alice transfers ownership position to another Bob user.
Bob cannot cancel the order because he is not the original maker of the order.

## Vulnerability Detail
To cancel the order you must be the original maker:

## Impact
Transferring of position ownership should allow the new user (the one that get the position ownership transferred to) to have the same functionality as the original owner.

## Code Snippet

The following test shows that after transferring a position canceling an order doesn't work anymore. It gets reverted with NOT_SIGNER reason.

```solidity
    function testCannotCancelTransferedOrder() public {
        BvbProtocol.Order memory order = defaultOrder();

        bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);
        bytes memory signature = signOrder(bullPrivateKey, order);
        bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);
        
        uint bobPK = 567;
        address bob = vm.addr(bobPK);

        vm.prank(bull);
        bvb.transferPosition(orderHash, true,bob);

        vm.prank(bob);
        vm.expectRevert("NOT_SIGNER");
        bvb.cancelOrder(order);
    }
```
## Tool used

foundry

## Recommendation
Instead of just checking the immutable ``order.maker`` field. Implement something like an ``approve`` mapping on transferring positions. Do not forget to cancel previous approved owner on every ownership transfer.
