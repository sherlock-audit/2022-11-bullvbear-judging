# [NAZ-M1] Signature Malleability Not Protected Against

## Summary
The current version being used of `@openzeppelin-contracts` is `4.7.0` which has known bugs with the `ECDSA` library.

## Vulnerability Detail
All of the conditions from the advisory are satisfied: the signature comes in a single `bytes` argument, `ECDSA.recover()` is used, and the signatures themselves are used for replay protection checks https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h

## Impact
The wrong, potentially now-malicious, address will be the valid `order.maker || sellOrder.maker`, which could lead to the loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
[`BvbProtocol.sol#L699`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L699)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider updating to at least version `4.7.3`.
