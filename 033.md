# Order fee should be treated as fee in matching order.

## Summary
Order fee should be treated as fee in matching order.

## Vulnerability Detail
Right now, the fee is charged based on the percentage of the order's collateral and the order's premium (See BvbProtocol.sol#L318-L323). Users need to pass in a higher or same order fee (See BvbProtocol.sol#L751) compared to the fee (BvbProtocol.sol#L95) but it is not used anywhere in the matchOrder function.

## Impact
The wrong fee is charged
