# A Bear can give a worst nft in the collection that is near 0 with out an agreement on it and cause the bull to get a bad deal

## Summary
A bear can give a bad nft from the collection and get its money back but since there is no agreement on the nft in the collection just the collection the bull can get cheated on.
## Vulnerability Detail
Alice(bear attacker)
bob(bull victim)
They agree on an order for a collection that has a greater price but  Alice transfers  nft(which tokenId 1=0.1 ether)
while the whole collection is above 1 ether which is cheating out the bull from a better nft which won't sell as well.
steps:
Alice gives the bad nft to the contract and they get their funds back
The bull gets the  bad nft for a loss that is not excepted 

## Impact
bear cheating on the bull 
## Code Snippet
```soliditiy
  try
            IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, bull, tokenId)
        {} catch (bytes memory) {
            // Transfer NFT to BvbProtocol
            IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(
                bear,
                address(this),
                tokenId
            );
            // Store that the bull has to retrieve it
            withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
i recommend to make sure  the entities of the order agree on specific tokenId or make this a know risk in the frontend
