# [Tomo-M3] Unsupported  Cryptopunks

## Summary

This protocol doesn’t support cryptopunks

## Vulnerability Detail

Cryptopunks are at the core of the NFT ecosystem. As one of the first NFTs, it embodies the culture of NFT marketplaces. By not supporting the trading of cryptopunks, Foundation is at a severe disadvantage when compared to other marketplaces. Cryptopunks have their own internal marketplace which allows users to trade their NFTs to other users. As such, cryptopunks does not adhere to the `ERC721` standard, it will always fail when the protocol attempts to trade them.

Here is an example [[implementation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol#L417-L424)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol#L417-L424) of what it might look like to integrate cryptopunks into the Foundation protocol.

```solidity
} else if (assetAddr == punks) {
// CryptoPunks.
// Fix here for frontrun attack. Added in v1.0.2.
bytes memory punkIndexToAddress = abi.encodeWithSignature("punkIndexToAddress(uint256)", tokenId);
(bool checkSuccess, bytes memory result) = address(assetAddr).staticcall(punkIndexToAddress);
(address owner) = abi.decode(result, (address));
require(checkSuccess && owner == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
data = abi.encodeWithSignature("buyPunk(uint256)", tokenId);
```

## Impact

Users cannot trade cryptopunks, the famous NFT collection in this protocol

## Code Snippet

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L394-L400](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L394-L400)

```solidity
// Try to transfer the NFT to the bull (needed in case of a malicious bull that block transfers)
try IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, bull, tokenId) {}
catch (bytes memory) {
    // Transfer NFT to BvbProtocol
    IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, address(this), tokenId);
    // Store that the bull has to retrieve it

    withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider designing a wrapper contract for cryptopunks to facilitate standard `ERC721` transfers.

The logic should be abstracted away from the user such that their user experience is not impacted.
