# If the `renounceOwnership` authorization is used, the project becomes unavailable

## Summary
`onlyOwner` has another secret import (from Ownable.sol) privilege: renounceOwnership()
They can use this authority whenever he wants, there is no restriction.
If he uses this authority, the very important functions detailed below will not be available, updated 


## Vulnerability Detail
We see the use of Openzeppelin in `Ownable.sol` in many contracts and owners can `renounceOwnership()` like this project, which is sometimes a positive as it reduces the risk of rugpull but the situation is a bit different here, Owner is constantly needed
(For example setAllowedAsset / withdrawFees) , so security risk is high

[BvbProtocol.sol#L4](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L4)


## Impact
Key powers of OnlyOwner;

```solidity
src/BvbProtocol.sol:
  821:     function setAllowedCollection(address collection, bool allowed) public onlyOwner {
  822          allowedCollection[collection] = allowed;

  832:     function setAllowedAsset(address asset, bool allowed) public onlyOwner {
  833          allowedAsset[asset] = allowed;

  842:     function setFee(uint16 _fee) public onlyOwner {
  843          // Fee rate can't be greater than 5%

  856:     function withdrawFees(address asset, address recipient) external onlyOwner {
  857          uint amount = withdrawableFees[asset];
```
Proof of Concept
1 - OnlyOwner does renounceOwnership() based on her authority in the Ownable.sol contract
2 - The project can start to 0 rate fee in initialize , than  increase to fee rate
3 - Unfortunately this cannot be done

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(address(0));
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of directly importing the `Ownable.sol` contract, a project-specific `Ownable.sol` should be used by removing the `renounceOwnership()` function, which is the subject of the above-mentioned potential problem.
