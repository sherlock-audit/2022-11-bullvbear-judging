# Overpayment of native ETH is not refunded to the buyer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Overpayments are likely in the case of auction orders priced in native ETH.
## Impact
these overpayments will be locked permanently: the owner cannot withdraw and refund overpayments manually.

Scenario:

- Alice creates a sell order for her token with constraints that set up a reverse 
Bull v Bear auction: start price `500`, end price `2000`, start time `1`, end time `5`.u
- Bob fills the order at time `2`. The calculated price is `875`. Bob is unsure when his transaction will be included, so provides a full `2000` wei payment.
- Bob's transaction is included at time `3`. The calculated price is `1250`.
- Bob's additional `750` wei are locked in the contract and not refunded.
