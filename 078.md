# checkIsValidSellOrder : start time and end time should not be same

## Summary
In `checkIsValidSellOrder`, there is validation to ensure that the block.time should be >= start time and <= end time.

This check will not capture one of the edge case, where start and end time both can be zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L799-L802

by looking at the condition check handling, it can allow for both start time and end time can be zero.

## Impact

Validating `checkIsValidSellOrder` with both start time == end time could be irrelevant.

## Code Snippet

        require(block.timestamp >= sellOrder.start, "INVALID_START_TIME");


        // Check that the sell order hasn't expired
        require(block.timestamp <= sellOrder.end, "SELL_ORDER_EXPIRED");

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add one more check to verify if start and end both are same. if so, revert.
