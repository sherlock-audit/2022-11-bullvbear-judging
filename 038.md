# Sell order start should not be less than order validity

## Summary
The sell order start should not be less than the order validity.

## Vulnerability Detail
See MyTest7.t.sol#L48-L87,  the test run successfully when order validity is set to `block.timestamp + 1  hour` (See MyTest7.t.sol#L51) but the sell order start is set to `block.timestamp` (See MyTest7.t.sol#L71). This means that anyone can sell an order which is not yet valid.

## Impact
Sell orders may start before the order is valid which is wrong.

## Tool used
Manual Review and added a test unit.

## Recommendation
Change this code (See BvbProtocol.sol#L799)

From 
```solidity
require(block.timestamp >= sellOrder.start, "INVALID_START_TIME");
```

to

```solidity
 require(block.timestamp >= sellOrder.start && order.validity <= sellOrder.start, "INVALID_START_TIME");
```
