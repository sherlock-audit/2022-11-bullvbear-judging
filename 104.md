# A bear can give the nft but then get the `premium+collateral` which they shouldn't get if they are the buyer of order

## Summary
A bear that pays the premium and fees can then transfer the nft and get the collateral + premium which is too many funds and then funds can be stolen
## Vulnerability Detail
Since there is no indication  that this is a put or call option the bear can pay the `preimum+fees` but they can  call `settleContract()` with  the nft and get the collateral which is more than the nft causing  loss of funds because 
what should happen is that in this case of `setttleContract` the bear is the writer to give the nft but that isn't checked in `settleContract`.
steps:
Alice(bear) 
bob(bull)
Alice takes the order and becomes the bear and pays (premium+fees)
Bob pays the `collateral + fees)
But Alice could give the nft but get `collateral+preimum`  which doesn't make sense because Alice  in `matchOrder`
pays the `preimum+fees` so in that case, Alice shouldn't be getting back the premium which is the incentive for the seller that the bull should get and is not getting.  


## Impact
This can lead to a loss of funds and the bull not getting the funds they desire and the buyer can always transfer the nfts and get Their premium back. 
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
       uint256 bearAssetAmount = order.premium + order.collateral;
        if (bearAssetAmount > 0) {
            // Transfer payment tokens to the Bear
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bear, bearAssetAmount);
        }
```
