# It is possible to match contracts that expire in the next block

## Summary
There is no constraint on the difference between validity and expiry. This could lead to orders being created that have a very small time between when they are matched and expire. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently a contract could be created where expiry is 1 second from validity. This contract could be matched  one block before it ends. 

## Impact
The impact would be that a contract can be matched by a Bull with a close to guaranteed profit for a Bull and loss of a Bear.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Any contract where expiry-validity < minimum time is either  a mistake or a result of a user not understanding what validity and expiry parameters are. I would recommend a reasonable minimum to make such contracts impossible to match.
