# Should not allow order settlement if block.timestamp < order.validity

## Summary
Should not allow order settlement if block.timestamp < order.validity.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, orders can be settled at any time before order.expiry (See BvbProtocol.sol#L386) where the order.validity is always less than the order.expiry (See BvbProtocol.sol#L748).  However, there is no checking to ensure that the order settlement needs to happen **ONLY** when the order is valid. (See MyTest6.t.sol#L71).

## Impact
Order is allowed to be settled even before it is valid which is incorrect.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/test/unit/MyTest6.t.sol#L48-L71

## Tool used
Manual Review and added a test unit.

## Recommendation
Add the following code just before BvbProtocol.sol#L386
```solidity
require(block.timestamp >= order.validity, "ORDER_HAVENT_START");
```
