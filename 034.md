# User may lose NFT

## Summary
If a NFT support both ERC721 and ERC1155 (For example, the asset token of [The Sandbox Game](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), a Top20 ERC1155 token on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokens-nft1155?sort=7d&order=desc), supports both ERC1155 and ERC721 interfaces.) then User may lose the NFT in scenario as described in POC

## Vulnerability Detail
1. A new order is created for an NFT `N` supporting both ERC721 and ERC1155
2. Contract is settled using `settleContract` function
3. Unfortunately NFT transfer failed to bull so instead NFT `N` is transferred to BvbProtocol contract

```solidity
try IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, bull, tokenId) {}
        catch (bytes memory) {
            // Transfer NFT to BvbProtocol
            IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, address(this), tokenId);
            // Store that the bull has to retrieve it
            withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
        }
```

4. A mapping of `withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull` is created so that bull can retrieve this later
5. Now before bull can withdraw this NFT, a new order is being created for same NFT N (remember NFT supports ERC1155 as well)
6. Contract is settled using `settleContract` function for this new order. Unfortunately again NFT transfer failed to bull so instead NFT `N` is transferred to BvbProtocol contract
7. But interesting part is `withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId]` will get overwritten with this new bull. This means the old bull now cannot withdraw his NFT

## Impact
Buyer will not get NFT even after paying

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise the `catch` block of `settleContract` function

```solidity
catch (bytes memory) {
            ...
            require(withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId]==address(0), "Cannot use this token");
            withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
        }
```
