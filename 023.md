# fee can change without the consent of users

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Fees are applied during withdraw, but can change between the time the order is filled and its terms are agreed upon and the withdrawal time, leading to a loss of the expected funds for the concerned users.

## Code Snippet

      'function setFee(uint16 _fee) public onlyOwner {'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Mitigation could be:

- Store the fees in `Order` and verify that they are correct when the order is filled, so they are hardcoded in the struct
- Add a timestamp: this wouldn’t fully mitigate but would still be better than the current setup
- Keep past fees and fee change timestamps in memory (for example in an array) to be able to retrieve the creation time fees at withdrawal
